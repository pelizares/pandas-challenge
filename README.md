 My Analysis: 

Just because a school has a higher budget per student does not mean they will have better test scores. In fact, schools that had a higher spending per student $630-680 tested worse that schools between $585-630 and schools with the lowest budget under $585 tested the best.
    
Schools that average 1000-2000 students did better than school with more that 2000 student and slightly better than schools with less then 100o students   
    
Charter schools tested better in all categories over district schools.
 
 
My next step would to check to see if this correlates to school size as well, then possible check student demographics to see how much impact they have including income, single parent homes vs two parent homes.
